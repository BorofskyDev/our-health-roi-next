          Welcome to Our Health ROI. By using this website, you&apos;re engaging
          with a citizen-built tool designed to connect people with information
          about NIH funding and facilitate communication with elected
          representatives. We&apos;ve created these terms to be straightforward
          and fair, emphasizing both your rights as a user and the boundaries
          necessary to keep this service sustainable and accessible for
          everyone.

            <BodyText>
              You&apos;re welcome to search for health conditions, view NIH
              funding data, and generate letters to your representatives as
              often as you need. The information is provided for educational and
              civic engagement purposes. We encourage you to use the data in
              conversations with policymakers, share insights with others, and
              integrate what you learn into your advocacy efforts. This is,
              after all, why we built this tool.

              While we don&apos;t require an account or login, we do ask that
              you use the site in good faith. The API that powers our searches
              has rate limits, and we want to ensure everyone has equal access
              to this resource. Please avoid automated scraping, excessive
              requests, or any activities that could overwhelm our systems and
              prevent others from accessing the service.

              communication with elected officials, how you use these templates
              is ultimately up to you. We simply ask that you maintain a
              respectful tone when representing yourself as a constituent.

              We strive to provide accurate information pulled directly from the
              NIH RePORTER API. However, we can&apos;t guarantee that the data
              is always complete or up-to-date, as we depend on external data
              sources. We present the data as-is, without warranties about its
              accuracy, completeness, or reliability. If you spot discrepancies
              in the data, we appreciate you letting us know so we can

              We aim for 24/7 availability, but as a small, citizen-led project,
              we may experience occasional downtime for maintenance or due to
              technical issues. Our service uses a secure connection (HTTPS),
              but no online transmission is 100% secure. Given that we collect
              minimal user data, the privacy risks are correspondingly low, but
              we still implement reasonable security measures to protect the
              integrity of the site.

              This project operates on a voluntary basis with minimal resources.
              We do not offer refunds, as we do not charge for access. Any
